# Pathfinding Visualizer

Hello! This project was created by Alexander Tomsovic!

This project was intended to be a fun project that you can use to try and create mazes or puzzles and figure our the best possible way to complete said puzzle. This will be updated and I hope to update it into a fully functioning 

tool for people who work in construction or architecture to be able to calculate walking distances and for example, calculate the walking distance from apartment x to apartment y and then to gym z. 

Hope you like it! :)

This application uses the following algorithms: 

*Dijkstra's Algorithm*: the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

*A* Search**: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

*Greedy Best-first Search*: a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

*Swarm Algorithm*: a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path

*Convergent Swarm Algorithm*: the faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path

*Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm*: Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path

*Breath-first Search*: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

*Depth-first Search*: a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path

i am also working on my own algorithm called the "Tomsorgarithm" which will find its path based on randomly generated index numbers 0,4 and will / 2. If the answer is < 1 the path will generate. This will repeat until the location has been found.
