PathfindR is a visual sorting program that illustrates how different sorting algorithms operate. PathfindR incorperates a multitude of sorting algorithms listed below and presents the user with a grid which they can alter with walls, beginning / ending nodes, and bombs. This allows the user to make their own layouts and see multiple cases of these algorithms in action! Jump into [**PatfindR**](https://alexandertomsovic.github.io/pathfindr/) or read more about each algorithm below! 

PLEASE NOTE: I am not the originator of this idea [**Clement Mihailescu**](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer), the creator of ALOGEXPERT was the original one to create this project and must be credited with the animations, sprites, and idea. I optimized some of his code and repackaged part of his UI tp give a better user experience. Make sure to check him and his work out!  

## Features
- 7+ advanced sorting algorithnms
- Beginner friendly visualization UI
- Multiple search nodes
- Area builder for visualization
- Prebuilt mazes and patterns
- Weighted nodes

## Algorithms With Shortest-Path Guarantee
- [**Dijkstra's Algorithm**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
- [**A Search**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [**Breath-first Search**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.

## Algorithms Without Shortest-Path Guarantee
- [**Greedy Best-first Search**](https://ai-master.gitbooks.io/heuristic-search/content/what-is-greedy-best-first-search.html): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path
- [**Swarm Algorithm**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/swarm-intelligence-algorithm): a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path.
- [**Convergent Swarm Algorithm**](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2013/384125/): the faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path.
- [**Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bidirectional-search/): Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path.



Depth-first Search: a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee shortest path. 

PLEASE NOTE: I am not the originator of this idea, used objects, nor animations. Clement Mihailescu, the creator of ALGOEXPERT was the original one to create this project. I used some of his animations, objects, and code to create a more efficient version of his program. I left his discord link and original instructions in the program. Be sure to check it out!
