# PathfindR V2.0 https://alexandertomsovic.github.io/pathfindr/

Hello! This project was created by Alexander Tomsovic!

This project was intended to be a fun project that you can use to visualize shortest path algorithms and how they operate. This will be updated and I hope to update it into a fully functioning

tool for people who work in construction or architecture to be able to calculate walking distances and for example, calculate the walking distance from apartment x to apartment y and then to gym z.

Hope you like it! :)

This application uses the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

A Search**: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

Greedy Best-first Search: a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

Swarm Algorithm: a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path.

Convergent Swarm Algorithm: the faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path.

Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm: Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path.

Breath-first Search: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.

Depth-first Search: a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee shortest path. 

PLEASE NOTE: I am not the originator of this idea, used objects, nor animations. Clement Mihailescu, the creator of ALGOEXPERT was the original one to create this project. I used some of his animations, objects, and code to create a more efficient version of his program. I left his discord link and original instructions in the program. Be sure to check it out!
